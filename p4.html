. Dataflow Programming (DFP) has been a research topic of
Software Engineering since the ‘70s. The paradigm models computer programs as a direct graph, promoting the application of dataflow diagram
principles to computation, opposing the more linear and classical Von
Neumann model. DFP is the core to most visual programming languages,
which claim to be able to provide end-user programming: with it’s visual
interface, it allows non-technical users to extend or create applications
without programming knowledges. Also, DFP is capable of achieving
parallelization of computation without introducing development complexity, resulting in an increased performance of applications built with
it when using multi-core computers. This survey describes how visual
programming languages built on top of DFP can be used for end-user
programming and how easy it is to achieve concurrency by applying the
paradigm, without any development overhead. DFP’s open problems are
discussed and some guidelines for adopting the paradigm are provided.
